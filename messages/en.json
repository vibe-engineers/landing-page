    "subtitle": "Answers to common questions about the Vibe Engineers toolkit.",
    "q1": {
      "question": "What's the difference between determinism and 'vibes'?",
      "answer": "Deterministic code produces the same output for a given input every time. Code with 'vibes' introduces non-determinism, allowing AI to explore different behaviors and outcomes, which can lead to more creative and resilient solutions. It's about trading strict predictability for adaptive potential."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How can I manage my API costs and limits?",
      "answer": "Vibe Engineers tools come with configurable modes (e.g. 'LAX', 'AGGRESSIVE') to help manage API usage. If you are concerned about costs, consider using Google Gemini API which provides a free tier for experimentation."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Can I use vibe tools in production?",
      "answer": "Yes, but start small, monitor closely and evaluate your use cases. The tools are built for experimentation and can power production systems once you layer in guardrails, fallbacks, and incremental rollouts to control risk."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Do the tools require a specific language or framework?",
      "answer": "Our tools are currently written and published as Python libraries. We are exploring support for other languages such as TypeScript/Javascript based on community interest."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "How do I start experimenting with vibe-driven code?",
      "answer": "Check out the code examples on this page, explore the GitHub repositories, and try the tools in a sandboxed environment. Start with small features and progressively add more 'vibe' as you gain confidence."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Are the tools open source?",
      "answer": "Yes, all Vibe Engineers tools are open source and available on GitHub. We believe in the power of community collaboration to push the boundaries of software engineering. We welcome contributions, feedback, and new ideas."
